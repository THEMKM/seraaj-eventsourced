You are INFRA_EVENTBUS, implementing Redis Streams event bus.

## Your Mission
Implement a real event bus using Redis Streams for cross-service communication. This replaces the current file-based event publishing with a distributed event streaming platform.

## Prerequisites
- Applications and Matching services have existing event publishing
- Redis available for development/testing

## Allowed Paths
- `infrastructure/event_bus.py` (CREATE)
- `services/applications/events.py` (MODIFY existing event publisher)
- `services/matching/service.py` (MODIFY to add event publishing)
- `bff/health_events.py` (CREATE for health monitoring)
- `.agents/checkpoints/eventbus.done` (CREATE only)
- `.agents/runs/INFRA_EVENTBUS/**` (CREATE only)

## Forbidden Paths
- NO modifications to other service files
- NO changes to contracts or frontend
- NO changes to core business logic in services

## Instructions

You are INFRA_EVENTBUS for Seraaj. Build a Redis Streams-based event bus for reliable cross-service communication.

### Required Deliverables

1. **Event Bus Implementation** (`infrastructure/event_bus.py`)
```python
from typing import Dict, List, Callable, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime
import redis.asyncio as redis
import json
import asyncio

@dataclass
class StreamEvent:
    id: str
    type: str
    timestamp: datetime
    payload: dict
    source_service: str

class RedisEventBus:
    def __init__(self, redis_url: str = "redis://localhost:6379"):
        self.redis = redis.from_url(redis_url)
        self.stream_name = "stream:events"
    
    async def publish(self, event_type: str, payload: dict, 
                     source_service: str = None) -> str:
        """Publish event to Redis stream"""
        
    async def subscribe(self, group: str, consumer: str, 
                       event_types: List[str], 
                       handler: Callable[[StreamEvent], None]) -> None:
        """Subscribe to events with consumer group"""
        
    async def create_consumer_group(self, group: str, 
                                   start_id: str = "0") -> bool:
        """Create consumer group if not exists"""
        
    async def get_stream_info(self) -> dict:
        """Get stream information for monitoring"""
        
    async def get_consumer_group_info(self, group: str) -> dict:
        """Get consumer group lag and status"""
```

2. **Event Types Registry** (`infrastructure/event_types.py`)
```python
# Centralized event type definitions
class EventTypes:
    # Application Events
    APPLICATION_CREATED = "application.created"
    APPLICATION_SUBMITTED = "application.submitted" 
    APPLICATION_STATE_CHANGED = "application.state.changed"
    
    # Matching Events
    MATCH_SUGGESTIONS_GENERATED = "match.suggestions.generated"
    MATCH_SUGGESTION_APPLIED = "match.suggestion.applied"
    
    # Auth Events (for future)
    VOLUNTEER_REGISTERED = "volunteer.registered"
    USER_LOGIN = "user.login"
    
    # System Events
    SERVICE_STARTED = "service.started"
    SERVICE_HEALTH_CHECK = "service.health.check"
```

3. **Applications Service Integration** (`services/applications/events.py`)
- Modify existing event publisher to ALSO publish to Redis (dual publishing)
- Maintain existing file-based publishing for backward compatibility
- Add Redis publishing for real-time cross-service communication

**Updated Event Publisher**:
```python
from infrastructure.event_bus import RedisEventBus
from infrastructure.event_types import EventTypes

class ApplicationEventPublisher:
    def __init__(self):
        self.event_bus = RedisEventBus()
        # Keep existing file publisher
        self.file_publisher = ExistingFilePublisher()
    
    async def publish_application_created(self, application: dict):
        # Existing file publishing
        await self.file_publisher.publish("application.created", application)
        
        # New Redis publishing
        await self.event_bus.publish(
            EventTypes.APPLICATION_CREATED,
            application,
            source_service="applications"
        )
    
    async def publish_application_submitted(self, application: dict):
        # Dual publishing pattern
        await self.file_publisher.publish("application.submitted", application)
        await self.event_bus.publish(
            EventTypes.APPLICATION_SUBMITTED,
            application,
            source_service="applications"
        )
```

4. **Matching Service Integration** (`services/matching/service.py`)
- Add event publishing when matches are generated
- Publish when volunteers apply to matched opportunities
- Maintain existing functionality

**Add to MatchingService**:
```python
from infrastructure.event_bus import RedisEventBus
from infrastructure.event_types import EventTypes

class MatchingService:
    def __init__(self):
        # Existing initialization
        self.event_bus = RedisEventBus()
    
    async def generate_quick_matches(self, volunteer_id: str, limit: int):
        # Existing matching logic
        matches = self._existing_matching_logic(volunteer_id, limit)
        
        # New: Publish match generation event
        await self.event_bus.publish(
            EventTypes.MATCH_SUGGESTIONS_GENERATED,
            {
                "volunteerId": volunteer_id,
                "matchCount": len(matches),
                "matches": [m.dict() for m in matches],
                "generatedAt": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
            },
            source_service="matching"
        )
        
        return matches
```

5. **BFF Health Monitoring** (`bff/health_events.py`)
```python
from infrastructure.event_bus import RedisEventBus
from fastapi import APIRouter
import asyncio

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/health/events")
async def get_event_health():
    """Monitor Redis event bus health and consumer lag"""
    event_bus = RedisEventBus()
    
    try:
        # Check Redis connectivity
        await event_bus.redis.ping()
        
        # Get stream info
        stream_info = await event_bus.get_stream_info()
        
        # Get consumer group status
        groups_info = {}
        for group in ["applications", "matching", "bff"]:
            try:
                groups_info[group] = await event_bus.get_consumer_group_info(group)
            except:
                groups_info[group] = {"status": "not_created"}
        
        return {
            "redis_connected": True,
            "stream_length": stream_info.get("length", 0),
            "consumer_groups": groups_info,
            "last_check": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            "redis_connected": False,
            "error": str(e),
            "last_check": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
        }
```

6. **Event Consumer Examples** (`infrastructure/consumers/`)
Create example consumers to demonstrate cross-service communication:

**Application Consumer** (`infrastructure/consumers/application_consumer.py`):
```python
async def handle_application_events(event: StreamEvent):
    """Example consumer for application events"""
    if event.type == EventTypes.APPLICATION_SUBMITTED:
        # Could trigger notifications, analytics, etc.
        print(f"New application submitted: {event.payload['id']}")
    elif event.type == EventTypes.APPLICATION_STATE_CHANGED:
        # Could update search indexes, send notifications, etc.
        print(f"Application {event.payload['id']} changed to {event.payload['status']}")

async def start_application_consumer():
    event_bus = RedisEventBus()
    await event_bus.create_consumer_group("applications", "0")
    await event_bus.subscribe(
        group="applications",
        consumer="app-consumer-1", 
        event_types=[EventTypes.APPLICATION_SUBMITTED, EventTypes.APPLICATION_STATE_CHANGED],
        handler=handle_application_events
    )
```

### Technical Specifications

**Dependencies** (add to requirements.txt):
```
redis[hiredis]>=5.0.0
```

**Environment Configuration**:
```bash
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
REDIS_STREAM_NAME=stream:events
REDIS_MAX_ENTRIES=10000
```

**Redis Stream Structure**:
```
stream:events
├── 1641234567890-0 { type: "application.created", payload: {...}, source: "applications", ts: "..." }
├── 1641234567891-0 { type: "match.suggestions.generated", payload: {...}, source: "matching", ts: "..." }
└── 1641234567892-0 { type: "application.submitted", payload: {...}, source: "applications", ts: "..." }
```

**Consumer Groups**:
- `applications` - Processes application-related events
- `matching` - Processes matching-related events  
- `bff` - Processes events for API aggregation/caching
- `analytics` - Future: processes events for reporting

### Testing Requirements

1. **Unit Tests** (`tests/infrastructure/test_event_bus.py`):
- Event publishing and retrieval
- Consumer group creation and management
- Error handling and reconnection logic
- Event serialization/deserialization

2. **Integration Test** (`tests/e2e/test_bus.py`):
```python
async def test_application_event_flow():
    """Test: submit application → consume event from stream"""
    # Submit application via Applications API
    response = await client.post("/api/applications", json=test_application)
    application_id = response.json()["id"]
    
    # Consumer should receive the event
    event_bus = RedisEventBus()
    events = await event_bus.get_events_since("applications", "0")
    
    assert any(
        event.type == EventTypes.APPLICATION_SUBMITTED 
        and event.payload["id"] == application_id
        for event in events
    )
```

3. **Performance Tests**:
- Measure event publishing latency (target: < 10ms)
- Test consumer processing throughput
- Verify no event loss under load

### Error Handling & Resilience
- Implement exponential backoff for Redis reconnection
- Handle Redis unavailability gracefully (log errors, continue operation)
- Consumer group recovery after failures
- Dead letter queue for failed event processing
- Circuit breaker pattern for Redis operations

### Monitoring & Observability
- Track event publishing rate and latency
- Monitor consumer lag for each group
- Alert on Redis connectivity issues
- Metrics on event processing success/failure rates

### Success Criteria
- Redis event bus publishes and consumes events reliably
- Applications service publishes events to both file and Redis
- Matching service publishes match generation events
- BFF health endpoint shows Redis status and consumer group lag
- E2E test passes: application submission → Redis event consumption
- No disruption to existing functionality
- Performance acceptable: < 10ms publishing latency

### Completion
Create `.agents/checkpoints/eventbus.done` with:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "redis_connected": true,
  "dual_publishing": true,
  "consumer_groups": ["applications", "matching", "bff"],
  "health_endpoint": "/api/health/events",
  "e2e_test_passing": true
}
```
