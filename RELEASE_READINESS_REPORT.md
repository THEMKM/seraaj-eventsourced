### Service Topology
```
Frontend (Next.js) → BFF (8000) → {
  ├── Auth Service (8004)
  ├── Applications Service (8001) 
  ├── Matching Service (8003)
  └── Domain Services (8005-8007)
}
```

### Phase 8: Observability Audit ✅ **PASSED**
**Completion:** 2025-08-11 23:54:00 UTC

**📊 Structured Logging Verified:**
- ✅ JSON format with ISO8601 timestamps
- ✅ Trace IDs flow across all service calls
- ✅ Business metrics emission (user registration, applications, etc.)
- ✅ Performance metrics tracking (operation duration)
- ✅ Consistent format across BFF, Auth, Applications, Matching services

**Sample Log Entry:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-11T23:52:16.645028Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "bff", 
  "message": "Business metric: bff_user_registered",
  "traceId": "8cfb313e-7d38-4dac-953a-434edbd1d15f",
  "operation": "business_metric",
  "metricName": "bff_user_registered",
  "metricValue": 1
}
```

### Phase 9: Fallback Drills ✅ **PASSED**
**Completion:** 2025-08-11 23:57:00 UTC

**🛡️ Resilience Testing:**
- ✅ **Matching Service Outage:** System gracefully degrades to "degraded" status
- ✅ **Error Handling:** Clear 503 responses with actionable error messages
- ✅ **Core Function Preservation:** Auth and Applications continue operating
- ✅ **Fast Recovery:** Immediate restoration upon service restart

**🔧 Port Configuration Corrections:**
- ✅ Fixed BFF Matching adapter: port 8002 → 8003
- ✅ Updated health check URLs to match SERVICE_PORTS.md
- ✅ All services confirmed on correct documented ports

### Phase 10: Frontend Polish ✅ **PASSED**
**Completion:** 2025-08-12 00:02:00 UTC

**🎨 Frontend Health:**
- ✅ **TypeScript:** All compilations pass workspace-wide
- ✅ **Linting:** Zero errors across all packages
- ✅ **Production Build:** Optimized bundles (87.1KB shared baseline)
- ✅ **Static Generation:** 9 pages pre-rendered successfully

**🔧 SDK Integration Fixes:**
- ✅ Fixed Configuration interface usage (was incorrectly using as class)
- ✅ Implemented dynamic token access for authenticated requests
- ✅ All workspace packages build and type-check successfully

   - Validate production configuration
   - Test with production-like data volumes

2. **🔧 Configure Production Environment**
   - Set environment-specific JWT secrets
   - Configure production CORS origins
   - Set up production database connections

3. **📊 Set Up Monitoring**
   - Implement log aggregation (ELK/Grafana)
   - Configure alerting for service health
   - Set up performance monitoring dashboards

4. **🔄 Establish CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Automate smoke test execution
   - Implement automated deployment gates
   - Set up rollback procedures
