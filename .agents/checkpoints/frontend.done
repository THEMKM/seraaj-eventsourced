FRONTEND_COMPOSER completion checkpoint

## Summary
Complete authentication integration and happy path user flow implemented for Seraaj frontend.

### Completed Tasks:

1. ✅ **BFF SDK Integration with Auth Endpoints**
   - Created v1.1.0 BFF OpenAPI spec with auth proxy endpoints
   - Generated complete TypeScript SDK with auth, volunteer, and system APIs
   - Integrated auth endpoints: `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/refresh`, `/auth/me`
   - Maintained existing volunteer endpoints with proper authentication

2. ✅ **Authentication System**
   - Implemented comprehensive AuthContext with JWT token management
   - Auto-refresh token logic with localStorage persistence
   - Proper error handling and token expiration checks
   - Type-safe integration with generated auth types

3. ✅ **UI Components & Forms**
   - Created 8-Bit Optimism styled form components (PxInput, PxSelect)
   - Built complete login and register forms with validation
   - Integrated design system with proper error states
   - Added responsive design and accessibility features

4. ✅ **Protected Routes & Navigation**
   - Implemented ProtectedRoute wrapper with role-based access
   - Created navigation header with auth state display
   - Proper redirects for authenticated/unauthenticated users
   - Loading states and error boundaries

5. ✅ **User Flows Implemented**
   - **Landing Page**: Dynamic content based on auth state
   - **Auth Page**: Toggle between login/register with URL params  
   - **Dashboard**: Volunteer profile, applications, quick match
   - **Happy Path**: Register → Login → Dashboard → Quick Match → Apply

6. ✅ **Dashboard Features**
   - User profile display with skills and availability
   - Active applications tracking with status
   - Quick match functionality with real BFF integration
   - Application submission with proper error handling

### Technical Implementation:

**Authentication Flow:**
- JWT tokens stored in localStorage with auto-refresh
- Protected routes redirect to auth with return URLs
- Comprehensive error handling for auth failures
- Type-safe user role management (VOLUNTEER, ORG_ADMIN)

**API Integration:**
- All HTTP calls through generated BFF SDK exclusively
- Authenticated API clients with Bearer token support
- Proper error boundaries and loading states
- Real integration with Applications and Matching services

**Design System:**
- Maintained 8-Bit Optimism aesthetic consistently
- Pixel art fonts (Press Start 2P) and retro color scheme
- Animated glow effects and proper contrast ratios
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### Verification Results:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: All types valid, no errors
- ✅ ESLint: All code passes linting with boundary enforcement
- ✅ Production build: Successfully builds static export
- ✅ Dev server: Starts successfully on localhost:3000
- ✅ Auth integration: Login/register/logout flows working
- ✅ Protected routes: Proper access control implemented

### Generated Files:
- Updated BFF OpenAPI spec: `contracts/v1.1.0/api/bff.openapi.yaml`
- Generated SDK: `packages/sdk-bff/src/*` with auth APIs
- Auth components: Login/Register forms with validation
- Dashboard: Complete volunteer dashboard with BFF integration
- Navigation: Header with auth state and user actions

### Integration Points Working:
- BFF Auth: `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, `/auth/me`, `/auth/refresh`
- BFF Data: `/volunteer/{id}/dashboard`, `/volunteer/quick-match`, `/volunteer/apply`
- Real service integration: Applications service, Matching service
- Type safety: Generated types used throughout frontend

### User Experience:
- Smooth authentication flows with proper feedback
- Fast page loads with optimized Next.js static generation
- Intuitive navigation with clear auth states
- Error handling with user-friendly messaging
- 8-Bit aesthetic maintained throughout

The frontend now provides a complete, production-ready authentication experience with minimal but functional volunteer management features, maintaining the established design system and architectural patterns.
