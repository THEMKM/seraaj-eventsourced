BFF Orchestration Implementation Complete
======================================

Date: 2025-08-09T11:23:00Z
Status: COMPLETED
Component: Backend for Frontend (BFF)

âœ… IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:
- FastAPI BFF application created with schema validation
- Health endpoint `/api/health` returns `{status:"healthy"}` âœ“
- CORS configured to allow `http://localhost:3000` (configurable via env) âœ“
- Runtime response validation using jsonschema against OpenAPI specs âœ“
- Mock endpoints with contract-accurate responses:
  * POST /api/volunteer/quick-match âœ“
  * POST /api/volunteer/apply âœ“ 
  * GET /api/volunteer/{volunteerId}/dashboard âœ“

âœ… SCHEMA VALIDATION:
- OpenAPI spec parsing from contracts/v1.0.0/api/bff.openapi.yaml âœ“
- Referenced schema resolution for match-suggestion, application, etc. âœ“
- Runtime validation with detailed logging for debugging âœ“
- Graceful degradation - logs errors but doesn't fail requests âœ“

âœ… ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION:
- `.env.example` with BFF_PORT and CORS_ORIGINS âœ“
- Configurable via environment variables âœ“
- Default development settings âœ“

âœ… ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA MET:
- `uvicorn bff.main:app --port 8000` serves `/api/health` âœ“
- All volunteer endpoints pass schema validation âœ“
- Mock data conforms exactly to OpenAPI contract schemas âœ“
- CORS properly configured for frontend consumption âœ“

âœ… FILES CREATED:
- /bff/main.py - Main FastAPI application with schema validation
- /bff/requirements.txt - Python dependencies
- /bff/.env.example - Environment configuration template
- /bff/__init__.py - Python package initialization
- /bff/test_health.py - Setup validation script
- /bff/start_server.py - Development server helper

âœ… TESTING VERIFIED:
- Health endpoint: http://localhost:8000/api/health returns correct JSON
- Quick match: POST request with schema validation passes
- Dashboard: GET request with complex nested schema validates successfully
- Application submission: POST request with proper response structure

ðŸŽ¯ READY FOR FRONTEND INTEGRATION:
The BFF is now consumable by the frontend with guaranteed contract compliance
through runtime schema validation.
