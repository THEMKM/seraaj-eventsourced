ORCHESTRATOR completion checkpoint

## Summary
BFF service has been updated to integrate with real backend services through HTTP adapters:

### Completed:
1. ✅ Created service adapters for Applications and Matching services
   - `bff/adapters/applications.py`: HTTP client for Applications service (port 8001)  
   - `bff/adapters/matching.py`: HTTP client for Matching service (port 8002)

2. ✅ Updated BFF main service to use real service calls instead of mocks
   - POST /api/volunteer/quick-match → calls matching.quick_match
   - POST /api/volunteer/apply → calls applications.submit_application  
   - GET /api/volunteer/{id}/dashboard → aggregates from both services + mock profile

3. ✅ Maintained schema validation middleware (jsonschema validation active)

4. ✅ Added httpx dependency for async HTTP calls (already in requirements.txt)

5. ✅ Implemented graceful error handling and service degradation

### Verified working endpoints:
- ✅ POST /api/volunteer/quick-match - Successfully calls Matching service
- ✅ POST /api/volunteer/apply - Successfully calls Applications service  
- ✅ GET /api/volunteer/{id}/dashboard - Successfully aggregates from both services
- ✅ GET /api/health/services - Service health monitoring working

### Service configuration (CORRECTED):
- BFF: http://127.0.0.1:8000
- Applications: http://127.0.0.1:8001  
- Matching: http://127.0.0.1:8002

### Runtime validation:
All endpoint responses pass OpenAPI schema validation via existing middleware.

### Test Results (2025-08-09T15:19:30Z):
- Quick-match with test-volunteer-123: ✅ Returned 3 matches from real matching service
- Application submission to opp1: ✅ Created application via real applications service
- Dashboard for test-volunteer-123: ✅ Shows real application and matches
- Duplicate application attempt: ✅ Proper error handling (400 status)
- Service health checks: ✅ Both services reporting healthy
